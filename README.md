Hi, I'm [Alessandro Nikolaev]: https://thewinterdev.webflow.io/, a passionate self-taught Game Developer from Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ who also dabbles in Front-End Development at times. 
My passion for software stems from the joy of coming up with ideas and turning them into a reality, using any form of computer science I see fit. I'm a perfectionist at heart so I'll always strive to create great user experience and maintain a clean and elegant code base.
